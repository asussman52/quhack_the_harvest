					Hunters provide information that helps the USFWS and state wildlife agencies set annual hunting regulations that minimize the risk of over-harvest and provide the most, and hopefully the best possible, opportunities for hunting. The Harvest 'Diary' surveys tell us how many people hunted ducks (... or geese, or doves, or woodcock, or ...) in each state, how many days they hunted, when and in what county they hunted, and how many birds were harvested each year. Because these surveys have been conducted for many years (... years with short hunting seasons, long seasons, various daily bag limits, and a range of season dates ...), we can predict what the harvest will be for a specific season length and daily bag limit.

						<p>We use state estimates of hunter numbers and the Diary survey responses to estimate harvest and hunting effort. Using ducks as an example, we multiply the average number of days people reported hunting ducks by the number of duck hunters to estimate the number of days people hunted ducks. Same thing for harvest - average number of ducks shot, as reported on the Diary surveys, times number of duck hunters gives us estimates of the number of ducks shot in each state.</p>

						<p>The Diary survey provides other important information - when and where birds are harvested. Although the USFWS decides the season length every year, each state wildlife agency chooses the hunting dates for their state. They try to select the dates that will provide the best hunting. Diary survey participants tell us the days they hunted and how many birds they harvested on each day. So, a state agency can look at the number of birds shot on each date for the past, say, 10 years, to figure out when the most birds are usually harvested in their state, and set their season to cover those dates.</p>

						<p class="overflow-hidden">Information about where birds are harvested is also important. Duck harvest is only high in areas where there are lots of ducks, and that's because those areas have good non-breeding duck habitat. So, the harvest survey can help the USFWS, state wildlife agencies, and other partners decide where they should use their resources to protect, maintain, and improve critical wetland habitats for waterfowl.</p>
