# Harvest Survey Storyboard Notes
From Hackathon Sept 26, 2017, Patuxent NWR

**Intro**

Brief background and objectives of the Survey, but might want to start users in the next section, but where they can see the Intro section greyed out and "clickable."

**Harvest Informatio Program (HIP) Registration, Sampling for Diary Survey**
  + Why do I have to register for HIP?
  + HIP registration questions are not the Survey!!!  Everyone registers, only some get selected 
  + *Maybe a simple illustration of Sampling—can we make it dynamic?*
  + Why did (or didn’t) I get picked? Based on answers to questions, number of hunters in your 	state, how many people hunt a given species (e.g, if you hunt woodcock, BT pigeons, rails, more 	likely to get picked)
  
  
**Diary Survey**—If I’m picked, what happens?
  + Why important?  Helps states determine when to set regs…so filling out daily can be important. Also used to guide habitat acquisition.
  + What does it tell you?  Hunters, days, ducks.
  + *#ducks/hunter /season   Select your state, or by the whole country. Might inform you on where 	to take a hunting vacation, though really can’t specifically advertise it like that.  And see how 	you compare to others.*
  + *Total duck or goose harvest by state?  Select your state, or the whole country.*
  + Diary survey gives total harvest….how to get harvest by species? PCS….
  
  
**Parts Collection Survey (PCS Survey)**—How do I get picked?  If I’m selected, what happens? (Some pics of wings and envelopes)
  + How do the ducks get identified?
	  1. Link to Carney PDFs
		2. *Link to instructional videos (need proper dress, lighting, dubbed over script)*
 
  + PCS gives answers to:
    1. *Where and when should I hunt?*
    2. *Where should I go to hunt __X___?  Map of harvest of various species by state? County?*
    
    
**Sum Up**

Some additional notes, covered a bit already, but here they are…..

Date info:
  + When does harvest occur?
  + When do people like to hunt?
  + Show date data for harvest in northern, mid-latitude, and southern states

State/county info:
  + Where do people go to hunt? (Especially out-of-state)
  + What are the best counties in my state to hunt?
  + Where should I go to harvest species X?
