**What do we learn from our harvest surveys?**

Information that hunters provide helps the USFWS and state wildlife agencies set annual hunting regulations that minimize the risk of over-harvest and provide the most, and hopefully the best possible, hunting opportunity.

The Harvest 'Diary' surveys tell us how many people hunted ducks (... or geese, or doves, or woodcock, or ...) in each state, how many days they hunted, when and in what county, and how many birds they harvested each year. 

We have conducted these surveys for many years ... years with short hunting seasons, long seasons, various daily bag limits, and a range of season dates ... and we can predict what the harvest will be for a specific season length and daily bag limit.

>*How do we know the total number of waterfowl (or dove, or woodcock) hunters in a state?* `[Click to bring up box with short explanation of HIP]` Hunters are required to register for the Harvest Information Program (HIP) in each state they hunt migratory game birds. Methods of registration vary from state to state - some states require a separate permit, others offer free HIP registration over the internet, etc. - so, before you hunt game birds, be sure you know what the state requires, especially if you're a nonresident! 

>*Someone registering for HIP might wonder "I get asked questions about my hunting when I register, is that all there is to the surey?"* No! Questions asked during HIP registration about how many birds you harvested the previous year help make sure we send surveys to the right people ... so that, for example, we send most of our dove surveys to people who hunt doves, rather than to waterfowl hunters. 

>States send their HIP registration information to the USFWS, and the USFWS selects a sample of hunters to send Diary surveys. Estimates of total hunters in your state are based on a combination of the number of HIP registrations sent in by the state and responses to the Diary survey. For example, if a state has 100,000 HIP registrants and 50% of the hunters who respond to the Diary survey for dove hunting in that state report that they hunted doves, the estimate of dove hunters for the state is 50% of total HIP registrants, or 50,000 hunters. Actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the gist of it.

We use state estimates of hunter numbers and the Diary survey responses to estimate harvest and hunting effort. Using ducks as an example, we multiply the average number of days people reported hunting ducks by the number of duck hunters to estimate the number of days people hunted ducks. Same thing for harvest - average number of ducks shot, as reported on the Diary surveys, times number of duck hunters gives us estimates of the number of ducks shot in each state.

The Diary survey provides other important information - when and where birds are harvested. Although the USFWS decides the season *length* every year, each state wildlife agency chooses the hunting dates for their state. They try to select the dates that will provide the best hunting. Diary survey participants tell us the days they hunted and how many birds they harvested on each day. So, a state agency can look at the number of birds shot on each date for the past, say, 10 years, to figure out when the most birds are usually harvested in their state, and set their season to cover those dates.
`(Bar chart showing harvest by date/week here - maybe contrast dove harvest, almost all of which occurs in the first couple of week, with ducks or geese)`

Information about where birds are harvested is also important. Duck harvest is only high in areas where there are lots of ducks, and that's because those areas have good non-breeding duck habitat. So, the harvest survey can help the USFWS, state wildlife agencies, and other partners decide where they should use their resources to protect, maintain, and improve critical wetland habitats for waterfowl.

>*The Waterfowl Diary survey only specifies ducks, geese, sea ducks, and brant. 
How do you know the harvest for individual species?* `[Click to navigate to a PCS specific page]` Many novice hunters can't identify the species of all the ducks they shoot, especially early in the season before birds have "colored up" into their distinctive breeding plumage. Even experienced hunters can have a tough time identifying some birds. That's why we don't ask for species information in the Waterfowl Diary survey. 

>But ducks can be identified to species just from their wing plumage, and geese from their tail feathers. `[link to a short species ID video clip here?]` So, we conduct another survey every year called the *Waterfowl Parts Collection survey* where 5,000 to 6,000 randomly selected waterfowl hunters send us a wing from every duck and the tail feathers of every goose they shoot throughout the hunting season. This survey tells us the species composition of each state's duck and goose harvests. [`GRAPHIC: Map of US, click on state shows statistics on average species composition, states labeled by top species?`] 

>We combine Parts information with the estimates of harvest from the Diary survey to get estimates of how many birds of each species were harvested. For example, say the estimated duck harvest (from the Diary survey) in state X was 200,000 birds, and 35% of the wings from that state in the Parts Survey were mallards. Then estimated mallard harvest in state X is 70,000 birds (35% of 200,000).

>We can also identify the sex of a duck from its wing, and whether it was a young-of-the-year bird or an adult. The ratio of young-of-the-year birds to adults gives a good measure of the productivity of each species compared to previous years. `[maybe a time series graph of age ratios for a species here?]` That, in turn, helps biologists keep track of how waterfowl populations are faring. The USFWS also measures annual productivity of dove, woodcock, and band-tailed pigeons with wing surveys.

>Duck wing identification can be a handy skill when you're having a good day in the duck blind, since you're only allowed to shoot one or two of some species. Male ducks are usually (but not always) easy to identify, but young-of-the-year females of several species are pretty drab "brown ducks" and look similar. For example, what is this duck? `[photo of immature female redhead]` What about this one? `[photo of female gadwall]` Do you have to worry about the next bird you shoot if you have already bagged one of these? Here's a `short video` that shows you how to tell a female mallard from a drake mallard that isn't colored up yet, just by looking at their wings. And here's a `longer one` that shows you what wing characteristics to look for to identify even the most nondescript ducks to species.   

>The Waterfowl Parts survey also asks hunters for date information, giving states the option to further refine their season date selections. For example, if most hunters in a state prefer to shoot mallards, the survey results can be used to show when the most mallards are shot in that state.

>If you are planning to hunt in a new place, for an uncommon species, or a combination of species, the "when and where" information from the Waterfowl Parts survey is useful ... pick a state, select the species, and dates and see which county might be best! `GRAPHIC: Click state, chloropleth of harvest by species and date?`
