# Project Purpose
The USFWS Division of Migratory Bird Management is modernizing a critical monitoring program: the 66 year old **Migratory Bird Harvest Survey** is moving from paper to the Internet. This digital transformation will allow the program to significantly improve both operational efficiency and data quality.  Moving online will also expand our ability to communicate with survey respondents (migratory bird hunters) and the general public.

At the same time the survey is going online, our informational website [flyways.us](https://flyways.us) is slated to be retired by the end of May 2018.  Some of the most popular content, including information about the [harvest survey](https://flyways.us/regulations-and-harvest/harvest-trends), is destined to migrate to our program [website](https://www.fws.gov/birds/).

These changes provide us an opportunity and incentive to develop more and better visualizations of the survey results for respondents and the public. What do we learn about migratory game birds and hunting from our survey? How do hunters contribute to our understanding of bird distribution and abundance? To better support, inform, and communicate with migratory game bird hunters, we plan to develop a web interface that highlights information learned from the harvest surveys and how it is used.

We need your creativity and help to develop interesting graphical displays and to design a visually appealing, easy to navigate, informationally rich webpage.

**Seeking:** Usability testers, accessibility experts, researchers, data cleaners, data visualization coders, writers, translators, subject-matter experts, content designers, and creative people.

# Project Impact
Sound scientific information and an engaged and supportive public are essential to successful wildlife management. Over the last century, collaborative efforts to manage migratory game birds have resulted in improved [habitat conditions](https://www.fws.gov/birds/get-involved/duck-stamp/history-of-the-federal-duck-stamp.php) and [healthy populations](https://flyways.us/status-of-waterfowl/population-estimates/2017-breeding-duck-population-estimates). To continue and build upon this success, we need to develop new avenues to communicate and interact with the interested public. This project will advance that communication and make federal data more visible, available, and accessible.

What we need:
1. Interesting and dynamic maps and graphics showing (1) the distribution of harvest, (2) changes in harvest over time, and (3) other interesting and compelling features of the harvest survey data.
2. Graphical displays and maps of (related) bird distribution data via, e.g., [eBird](http://ebird.org) or [USGS BISON](https://bison.usgs.gov/).
3. Plain language descriptions of the harvest data and its use in wildlife management. Follow this [link](http://www.fws.gov/birds/surveys-and-data/harvest-surveys.php) to learn more about harvest surveys!
4. Ideas and plans for an accessible, informative, and easy to maintain webpage to display survey results.
